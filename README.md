# B-Pose: Bayesian Deep Network for Camera 6-DoF Pose Estimation from RGB Images

Here, we introduce, B-Pose, a Bayesian Convolutional deep network capable of not only automatically estimating the camera's pose parameters from a single RGB image but also provides a measure of uncertainty in the parameter estimation.

P.S. This code is built on top of the DSAC* work ([here]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_X0vzP4q8xth3tVSR_-uOePBQq9vQLUS/view?usp=sharing](https://github.com/vislearn/dsacstar)https://github.com/vislearn/dsacstar/view?usp=sharing)).
