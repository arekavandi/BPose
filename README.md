# B-Pose: Bayesian Deep Network for Camera 6-DoF Pose Estimation from RGB Images

Here, we introduce, B-Pose, a Bayesian Convolutional deep network capable of not only automatically estimating the camera's pose parameters from a single RGB image but also provides a measure of uncertainty in the parameter estimation.

P.S. This code is built on top of the [DSAC*](https://github.com/vislearn/dsacstar).
